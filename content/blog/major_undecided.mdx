Knowing what you want to major in before starting college application essays can be immensely beneficial for several reasons. This clarity of direction not only streamlines the application process but also allows you to present a more coherent and compelling narrative to admissions officers.

Firstly, having a clear idea of your intended major demonstrates focus and commitment to your academic and career goals. Admissions officers are looking for students who are driven and passionate about their chosen fields of study. When you can articulate your academic interests and aspirations coherently in your essays, it showcases your readiness to dive deep into your studies and make meaningful contributions to your chosen field.

Moreover, knowing your intended major allows you to tailor your application essays to highlight your relevant experiences, achievements, and aspirations. Whether you've conducted research projects, participated in internships, or engaged in extracurricular activities related to your major, incorporating these experiences into your essays helps paint a vivid picture of your qualifications and readiness for college-level study. It also makes for a much more detailed and memorable essay.

Additionally, having a clear major in mind enables you to explore college options more strategically. You can research and target institutions known for their strength in your chosen field, ensuring that you find the best fit for your academic interests and goals. Moreover, some colleges and universities have specific programs, resources, or opportunities tailored to certain majors, and knowing your intended major allows you to take advantage of these offerings.

Furthermore, knowing your intended major can influence other aspects of the college application process, such as your choice of recommenders and your application strategy. For example, you may seek letters of recommendation from teachers or mentors in your intended field who can speak to your academic abilities and potential. Additionally, you can focus your application essays on showcasing your passion for your chosen major and how your academic and extracurricular experiences have prepared you for success in that field.

Lastly, and most vitally – there are some very competitive academic majors that are ONLY open to students who apply directly for them in their college applications, for example — Computer Science at CMU and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins. It will be next to impossible to transfer into these majors later on. So if there is a chance that you may want to consider these directions, you essentially must choose to apply for them directly when you submit your college application (and hopefully you will have significant background in these majors in order to be competitive…). 

In sum – knowing what you most likely want to major in before starting college application essays is helpful for several reasons. It demonstrates focus and commitment, allows you to tailor your essays to highlight relevant experiences, helps you target colleges strategically, and influences other aspects of the application process. By presenting a clear and coherent narrative of your academic interests and aspirations, you increase your chances of standing out to admissions officers and finding the best college fit for your future success.
