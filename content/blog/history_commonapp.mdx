The Common Application, often referred to as the Common App, has become the most ubiquitous tool in the college admissions process. Ever wonder about its history? Well, in case you were curious â€” its origins date back to the mid-1970s.

The idea for a common application system emerged in 1975, when 15 private colleges and universities in the northeastern United States (Amherst, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, Smith, and more) formed the "Common Application Group" with the goal of streamlining the admissions process for both students and institutions. The initial focus was on creating a standardized application form that could be used by multiple colleges, simplifying the process for students applying to multiple institutions.

In 1975, the Common Application was launched with a single application form that students could use to apply to any of the member institutions. This marked the beginning of a collaborative effort among colleges and universities to make the admissions process more efficient and accessible.

Over the years, the Common Application continued to evolve and grow. In 1998, the Common App launched its first online application platform, allowing students to submit their applications electronically for the first time. This digital transformation revolutionized the college admissions process, making it faster, more convenient, and more environmentally friendly.

Since then, the Common Application has expanded its membership to include hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States and even some international institutions. Today, the Common App is a centralized application platform used by millions of students each year to apply to a wide range of colleges and universities.

The Common Application has also evolved to offer additional features and services beyond the basic application form. These include tools for requesting letters of recommendation, submitting supplementary materials such as portfolios or writing samples, and tracking application progress. The platform continues to adapt to the changing needs of students and colleges, aiming to make the college admissions process as smooth and transparent as possible.

Overall, the Common Application has played a transformative role in the college admissions landscape, simplifying the application process for students while promoting collaboration and standardization among colleges and universities. It remains a vital tool for students seeking to pursue higher education opportunities across the United States and beyond.
