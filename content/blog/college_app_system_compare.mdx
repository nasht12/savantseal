In addition to the Common Application (Common App), which is widely used by many colleges and universities across the United States, there are several other application systems that students may encounter when applying to US colleges. These include:

College-Specific Applications: Some colleges and universities, like Georgetown and MIT, have their own application systems that are used exclusively for their institution. These applications may have unique essay prompts, requirements, and submission processes tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the individual college or university.

State-Specific Applications: Certain states have their own application systems for public colleges and universities within the state. For example, the University of California (UC) system has its own application platform called the UC Application, which is used by all UC campuses. Similarly, the State University of New York (SUNY) system has its own application system called the SUNY Application.

Coalition Application: The Coalition Application is another centralized application platform that allows students to apply to a diverse group of colleges and universities. It emphasizes access, affordability, and student success, and includes features such as an online portfolio where students can showcase their achievements and projects.

Universal College Application (UCA): The Universal College Application is similar to the Common App but is accepted by a smaller number of colleges and universities. It provides students with an alternative option for submitting their applications, particularly if their desired colleges do not accept the Common App.

Overall, while the Common Application is the most widely used centralized application platform for US college admissions, students may encounter a variety of other application systems depending on the institutions to which they are applying. It's essential for students to research and familiarize themselves with the specific application requirements and processes for each college or university on their list. And remember, always prepare these application forms well in advance â€” some of these application systems like the UC system are notoriously long.
