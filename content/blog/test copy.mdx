Choosing which schools to apply to is a critical decision for prospective college students, shaping their educational journey and future opportunities. While each student's priorities and preferences may vary, several key factors commonly influence their decision-making process. Here, we explore the top 15 factors that students consider when choosing what school to apply to:

Academic Reputation: Students often prioritize schools with strong academic reputations, renowned faculty, and rigorous academic programs that align with their interests and career goals. Ranking systems like US News and QS World rankings can be useful tools to evaluate reputation, but it may also depend on more subjective factors.
Location: The location of a college – whether urban, suburban, or rural – can significantly impact a student's college experience, influencing factors such as campus culture, access to internships and job opportunities, and quality of life.
Campus Size: The size of a college campus – ranging from small liberal arts colleges with a little over a thousand students to large research universities with over 20 thousand undergraduate students– can affect class sizes, student-faculty ratios, and the sense of community and belonging.
Cost and Financial Aid: Affordability is a crucial consideration for many students and their families, with factors such as tuition, room and board, and availability of financial aid and scholarships playing a significant role in the decision-making process.
Reputation of Specific Programs: Students may prioritize schools known for excellence in specific academic programs or fields of study, such as business, engineering, or the arts. Note that sometimes schools with relatively lower rankings in US News may have top-tier programs for select majors. 
Campus Culture and Environment: The campus culture, social scene, and overall environment can influence a student's sense of belonging and satisfaction with their college experience.
Diversity and Inclusion: Students may seek out schools with diverse student populations, inclusive policies, and supportive resources for underrepresented or marginalized communities.
Extracurricular Opportunities: The availability of extracurricular activities, clubs, and organizations can enrich the college experience, providing opportunities for leadership, personal growth, and social connections.
Internship and Job Placement Opportunities: Students may consider schools with strong connections to industry partners, robust career services, and high rates of internship and job placement.
Campus Facilities and Resources: Access to state-of-the-art facilities, libraries, research centers, and other resources can enhance the academic experience and support students' personal and professional growth.
Study Abroad and Global Opportunities: Schools that offer study abroad programs, international exchange opportunities, and global engagement initiatives may appeal to students seeking cross-cultural experiences and perspectives.
Graduation Rates and Alumni Success: Students may research graduation rates, alumni outcomes, and career trajectories of graduates to gauge the long-term value and impact of a college education.
Campus Safety and Security: Ensuring a safe and secure campus environment is a top priority for many students and their families, influencing their perception of a school's suitability and desirability.
Admissions Selectivity: Students may consider the admissions selectivity and acceptance rates of colleges, weighing their chances of acceptance against their academic credentials and qualifications.
Personal Fit and Gut Feeling: Ultimately, students often rely on their intuition and gut feeling when choosing which schools to apply to, seeking out institutions where they feel a sense of connection, belonging, and excitement about the possibilities ahead.
In conclusion, choosing what school to apply to is a complex and deeply personal decision, influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from academic reputation and location to campus culture and personal fit. By carefully considering these factors and conducting thorough research, students can identify the schools that best align with their academic, personal, and professional goals, setting themselves up for success in their college journey and beyond.
