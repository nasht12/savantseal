## Understanding Standardized Tests: SATs and ACTs

Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are often a focal point of college applications. They are designed to measure a student's readiness for college and provide colleges with a common data point that can be used to compare all applicants.

- **SAT**: The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It measures mathematical, reading, and writing skills, and includes an optional essay.
  
- **ACT**: The ACT is another major standardized test for college admission, covering English, mathematics, reading, and science, with an optional writing test.

Both tests are accepted by most colleges and universities in the U.S., and your choice between the two may depend on your personal strengths and testing style. Itâ€™s important to prepare thoroughly for these exams, as they play a crucial role in college admissions.
